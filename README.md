# Old Python Examples – Statistical Modelling & ML Snippets

This repository collects a set of Python examples I originally wrote while developing material for the GM-RKB (Gabor Melli Research Knowledge Base). The code is intentionally small and focused. Each script demonstrates one idea in regression, statistical testing, or neural networks.

**Note:** These are *examples*, not production libraries. They are meant to be read, modified, and reused as starting points for analysis.

## Repository Structure

### `NN_examples/`

Neural-network regression examples (scikit-learn `MLPRegressor`) on the Boston
housing dataset:

- `MLP_regression_10foldcv_boston.py` – multi-layer perceptron regression with
  10-fold cross-validation.
- `SVM_regression_10foldcv_boston.py` – support-vector regression on the same
  dataset, for comparison.
- `MLP_1.png`, `MLP_2.png`, `MLP_3.png` – example learning-curve / prediction
  plots generated by the scripts.

### `statistical_test/`

Classical statistical and regression examples, mostly built around small,
well-known datasets:

- One- and two-sample t-tests (`1samp_ttest_1.py`, `2samplepaired_braindata.py`).
- Linear regression with cross-validation (`Linear_regression_10fold.py`).
- Regularized regression:
  - `RidgeRegression_boston10foldcv.py`
  - `Lasso_Boston_cv_predict.py`
  - `ENRegression_boston10foldcv.py`
  - `ARDRegression_boston10foldcv.py`
  - `BRRegression_boston10foldcv.py`
- Tree-based and SVM regression:
  - `regressiontrees_10foldcv.py`
  - `SVM_regression_boston10foldcv.py`
- Simple worked examples such as `simpleleastsquare.py`,
  `welchtestexample.py`, etc.

Most scripts print basic diagnostics (scores, coefficients) and can easily be
extended with additional plots or metrics.

### `decision_tree_emv_evpi_example.py` (new)

A small, self-contained example of **decision analysis**:

- Models a batch-size decision under uncertain demand.
- Computes EMV (expected monetary value) for each option.
- Computes the expected value with perfect information (EV with PI) and the
  resulting EVPI.
- Generates a simple decision-tree diagram:

```bash
  python statistical_test/decision_tree_emv_evpi_example.py
```

which writes `emv_evpi_decision_tree.png` to the current directory.

### `miscellaneous/`

Miscellaneous helper scripts, experiments, and scratch work that don’t fit
neatly into the folders above. These are left here for completeness and may be
useful as lightweight references for syntax or quick experiments.

## How to Use This Repository

* Treat each script as a **worked example**.
* Run them from the command line, read the code, and adapt to your own
  datasets.
* For Upwork / portfolio purposes, this repo shows:

  * Familiarity with classical statistical tests.
  * Hands-on practice with regression models (linear, regularized, tree-based,
    SVM, neural nets).
  * A concrete EMV / EVPI decision-tree example.
